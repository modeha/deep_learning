<h4 id="51-best-practices-for-ai-deployment"><strong>5.1 Best Practices for AI Deployment</strong></h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ensuring Reproducibility</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>To guarantee that model predictions are consistent across environments and deployments, always containerize AI applications using Docker.</li>
      <li>Store configuration files, environment variables, and dependencies with each deployment. Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage changes and ensure reproducibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Effective Data Management</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up robust data pipelines for ingestion, preprocessing, and storage, ensuring that data is secure and accessible only to authorized users.</li>
      <li>Regularly update training data to maintain model performance, particularly in dynamic environments where real-time data evolves.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Optimizing Model Performance</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Optimize model efficiency for production by reducing model size through techniques like quantization or pruning. These techniques reduce computational load without significant performance trade-offs.</li>
      <li>Use monitoring metrics like latency and throughput to evaluate performance, especially under load in real-world scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Modular Design for Scalability</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a modular architecture where the model, front-end, and data processing are separate components. This allows independent updates and scaling of each module.</li>
      <li>Integrate APIs to separate model inference logic from the front-end, making it easier to swap models or adjust settings without impacting the UI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
