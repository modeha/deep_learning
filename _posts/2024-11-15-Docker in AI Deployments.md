   - **Deploying with Azure Container Instances (ACI)**
     - **What is ACI?**: Azure Container Instances allow you to deploy Docker containers without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure, offering quick, isolated environments ideal for testing and development.
     - **Step-by-Step Guide to Deploying with ACI**:
       1. **Push Your Docker Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)**:
          - Azure Container Registry is a private registry to store Docker images. Use the following steps:
            ```bash
            az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry --sku Basic
            az acr login --name myContainerRegistry
            docker tag my-ai-app myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io/my-ai-app
            docker push myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io/my-ai-app
            ```
       2. **Deploy the Docker Image to ACI**:
          - Create a container instance with the image:
            ```bash
            az container create \
              --resource-group myResourceGroup \
              --name myAIAppContainer \
              --image myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io/my-ai-app \
              --cpu 1 --memory 1 \
              --registry-login-server myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io \
              --registry-username <username> \
              --registry-password <password> \
              --dns-name-label my-ai-app \
              --ports 80
            ```
       3. **Access Your Deployed App**:
          - Once deployed, the app will be accessible at the DNS name provided (`http://my-ai-app.region.azurecontainer.io`).

   - **Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines with Azure DevOps**
     - **Azure DevOps Pipelines**: Azure DevOps provides pipelines for automating build, test, and deployment stages, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
     - **Creating a CI/CD Pipeline**:
       - Use Azure DevOps to set up a pipeline that builds Docker images, pushes them to ACR, and deploys to ACI or AKS.
       - Azure Pipelines YAML file example:
         ```yaml
         trigger:
           branches:
             include:
               - main
         pool:
           vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
         steps:
         - task: Docker@2
           inputs:
             containerRegistry: 'myContainerRegistry'
             repository: 'my-ai-app'
             command: 'buildAndPush'
             tags: '$(Build.BuildId)'
         - task: AzureCLI@2
           inputs:
             azureSubscription: '<Your Subscription>'
             scriptType: 'bash'
             scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
             inlineScript: |
               az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAIAppContainer --image myContainerRegistry.azurecr.io/my-ai-app:$(Build.BuildId) --cpu 1 --memory 1 --dns-name-label my-ai-app --ports 80
         ```

#### **2.6 Example Deployment Workflow: End-to-End**

   - **Designing the Deployment Pipeline**:
     - A typical pipeline would start with code changes pushed to a Git repository, triggering an Azure DevOps pipeline.
     - The pipeline builds the Docker image, tests it, and pushes it to ACR.
     - Finally, ACI or AKS pulls the image, deploys the model, and the service is live.

   - **Implementing Continuous Improvement**:
     - Regularly monitor model performance and usage.
     - Use automated tests in Azure DevOps to ensure model updates do not break functionality.
     - Incorporate regular model retraining as new data is available, updating the model in AML and redeploying.
