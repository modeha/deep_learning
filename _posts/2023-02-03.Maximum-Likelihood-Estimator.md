Suppose that we have access to some data set as follow:
$$x^{(1)},x^{(2)},x^{(3)},\cdots x^{(n)}$$.
Our main intresting question is:
can we find a random variable $$X$$ and distribution $$P$$ such that $$p(X)$$ can  well-modeled our data by this distribution?. In general, this is a hard problem. If we consider the class of all possible distributions, there is no way to best fit to the data.

Instead, the common strategy is to choose our distribution from a certain parameterized family of distribution $$p(X;θ)$$, parameterized by $$θ$$, and have our goal be to find the parameters $$θ $$ that fit the data best. Even here there are multiple different approaches that are possible, but at the very least this gives us a more concrete problem that lets us better attack the underlying problem.

In this set of notes, we’ll first answer this estimation problem by appeal to the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure.
