### **1. Encapsulation**
   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
   **Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to certain parts of an object to ensure better control and data integrity**.
   - **Purpose**: Protect the data from unauthorized access and ensure proper control.
   - **Example**: Using private attributes and getter/setter methods (as explained above).

---

### **2. Abstraction**
   - **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of hiding unnecessary implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
   - **Purpose**: Simplifies complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.
   - **Example in Python**:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

     class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class
         @abstractmethod
         def make_sound(self):
             pass

     class Dog(Animal):
         def make_sound(self):
             return "Bark!"

     class Cat(Animal):
         def make_sound(self):
             return "Meow!"

     dog = Dog()
     print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark!
     ```
     - `Animal` defines an abstract class with an abstract method `make_sound`. The subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`) provide specific implementations.

---

### **3. Inheritance**
   - **Definition**: Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent/superclass).
   - **Purpose**: Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Example in Python**:
     ```python
     class Vehicle:
         def __init__(self, brand, model):
             self.brand = brand
             self.model = model

         def display_info(self):
             return f"Vehicle: {self.brand} {self.model}"

     class Car(Vehicle):  # Inheriting from Vehicle
         def __init__(self, brand, model, doors):
             super().__init__(brand, model)
             self.doors = doors

         def display_info(self):
             return f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}, Doors: {self.doors}"

     car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 4)
     print(car.display_info())  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla, Doors: 4
     ```
     - `Car` inherits from `Vehicle` and adds its own specific behavior (`doors` attribute).

---

### **4. Polymorphism**
   - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object calling it.
   - **Purpose**: Promotes flexibility and scalability in code.
   - **Example in Python**:
     ```python
     class Shape:
         def area(self):
             pass

     class Rectangle(Shape):
         def __init__(self, width, height):
             self.width = width
             self.height = height

         def area(self):
             return self.width * self.height

     class Circle(Shape):
         def __init__(self, radius):
             self.radius = radius

         def area(self):
             return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

     shapes = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3)]

     for shape in shapes:
         print(shape.area())
     ```
     - Output:
       ```
       20
       28.26
       ```
     - Both `Rectangle` and `Circle` have the `area` method, but they implement it differently.

### Summary of OOP Principles:
| **Concept**      | **Definition**                                                      | **Purpose**                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Protects data and ensures controlled access using access modifiers. | Data protection and integrity              |
| **Abstraction**   | Hides implementation details and focuses on functionality.          | Reduces complexity and increases usability |
| **Inheritance**   | Enables one class to inherit properties and methods from another.   | Code reuse and hierarchical relationships  |
| **Polymorphism**  | Allows the same method to behave differently for different objects.  | Flexibility and dynamic method execution   |
